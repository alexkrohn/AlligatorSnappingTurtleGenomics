## Structure Analysis

This script automates the three Structure analyses run in the paper. The inputs are 1) the main/unfiltered VCF, 2) a metadata file of the individuals one wants to run the analysis on, and 3) the K values one wants to test for each run.

The script will output meanQ values, and Evanno tables (including Delta K and Ln(P|K)) for each K.
