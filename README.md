# Population Genomics of Alligator Snapping Turtles

This repo contains scripts necessary to reproduce all of the analyses conducted in our forthcoming paper examining population structure across extant Alligator Snapping Turtles. The raw VCF that is subsetted for each of the analyses is available on [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.7291/D17H67).


If you use these scripts or analyses in your work, please cite the original program's creators, and:
