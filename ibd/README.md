## Isolation by Distance Graph and Mantel Test 

This script leads you through the process of plotting pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> against pairwise geographic distance (in km).

Because of poaching concerns for Alligator Snapping Turtles, we did not include latitude and longitude values in this public repository. The code can used to reproduce our general plots, but the latitude and longitude values must be made up.
